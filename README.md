# Chatbot Assistant

## Description

This project is a chatbot assistant that integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4 model to answer questions based on user input and document uploads. The chatbot allows users to interact with the assistant by sending messages and uploading documents (e.g., PDFs, DOCX, and text files). It uses the OpenAI API for generating responses and supports dynamic document content extraction.

## Features

- Chat with the assistant based on conversation history.
- Upload documents and extract text from them (PDF, DOCX, and text files).
- Chatbot will continue answering questions based on the uploaded documents, even after multiple messages.
- Real-time interaction with the OpenAI GPT-4 model.
